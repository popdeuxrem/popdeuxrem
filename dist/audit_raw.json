This occurs because the underlying connection is reused from the session's connection pool, causing the initial TLS verification setting to persist for the lifetime of the pooled connection. As a result, applications may unintentionally send requests without certificate verification, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and compromised confidentiality or integrity.  This behavior affects versions of `requests` prior to 2.32.0."}, {"id": "CVE-2024-47081", "fix_versions": ["2.32.4"], "aliases": ["GHSA-9hjg-9r4m-mvj7"], "description": "### Impact  Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.  ### Workarounds For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on your Requests Session ([docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env)).  ### References https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6965 https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2"}]}, {"name": "python-dateutil", "version": "2.8.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "charset-normalizer", "version": "3.4.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "3.11", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.6.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "certifi", "version": "2026.1.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "six", "version": "1.17.0", "vulns": []}], "fixes": []}
